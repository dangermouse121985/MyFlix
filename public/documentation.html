      <h1>My Flix API Documentation</h1>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <div>
        To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The
        web application will provide users with access to information about
        different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up,
        update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite
        movies.
